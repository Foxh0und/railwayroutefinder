1. The distance of the route A-B-C.
2. This question is rubbish.
.The distance of the route B-A-.
3. The distance of the route A-B but doesn't end in period so should be ignored
8. The length of the shortest route (in terms of distance to travel) from A to C.
6. The number of trips starting at C and ending at C with a maximum of 3 stops.  In the sample data below, there are two such trips: C-D-C (2 stops). and C-E-B-C (3 stops).
7. The number of trips starting at A and ending at C with exactly 4 stops.  
9. The number of different routes from C to C with a distance of less than 30.
